Fabric Sensor Application

## "Wizard of Oz" Solution
Link to Site: [insert glitch link here] 

This solution bypasses the need to read and transfer data from the sensor fabric. A user will still tap a patch on the fabric, but a researcher will click the corresponding button on the screen. The press of the button is what will send the data rather than the touch of the sensor.
